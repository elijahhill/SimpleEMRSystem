# Simple EMR System

This code can be used for Electronic Medical Record Research.

Coming soon - More screenshots and additional formatting

## Inital environment setup - all
If you already have a development environment set up that includes git, python 3.10, and an IDE of choice 

skip to [Setting up the project](#setting-up-the-project)

Otherwise -

- If installing on a Windows machine skip to [Initial environment setup - Windows](#initial-environment-setup---windows)

- If installing on a Mac, skip to [Initial environment setup - Mac](#initial-environment-setup---mac)

Linux is not supported for use, as the full dataset requires Box, and Box support for Linux was dropped in 2018.

However, it is possible to run the demo information on Linux.

## Initial environment setup - Windows

### Git
Fetch git from https://git-scm.com/download/win

Download and install 64-bit Git for Windows Setup.

The default settings for the installer will work for what we need

### Python
Install the latest version of python 3.10 (3.10.4 at the time of writing)

https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3104/

Use the windows installer (64-bit)

Within the installer, check the box for "Add python 3.10 to PATH"

Otherwise default options are correct

### IDE (VsCode)
Install VsCode from https://code.visualstudio.com/

You're free to install the IDE of your choice, but VsCode is both light, and works well as an IDE.

After VsCode is installed, skip to [Setting up the project](#setting-up-the-project).

## Initial environment setup - Mac
Note that I wasn't able to test this section, as I don't have a mac, nor a mac environment to test the installation instructions

### Homebrew
Installing development tools on a mac tends to require homebrew. Thus, we'll install it first.

Copy and paste the command below into a terminal 

command + c to copy

command + v to paste

`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)`

Then press enter to run the command

### Git
Similar to how you previously used the terminal, run the below command as well:

`brew install git`

### Python
Install python with:

`brew install python@3.10`

### IDE (VsCode)
One last installation: 

`brew install --cask visual-studio-code`

Continue onto [Setting up the project](#setting-up-the-project)

## Setting up the project
Now that the environment is set up, we can move onto setting up and running the app.
### Getting the webapp
Using VsCode, open up the folder you want to copy SEMR into (using file > open folder)

Open the terminal
- Click View
- Select "Terminal" from the menu

Once that folder is opened, from the terminal within VsCode, run -

`git clone https://github.com/elijahhill/SimpleEMRSystem`

### Setting up virtual environment
Similar to what you did in the previous section - 

Open the newly created folder in VsCode 

Re-open the terminal

From that terminal, run - 

`python -m venv SEMRenv`

After this completes, VsCode will ask you if you want to set this as the default workspace, select yes

If you were able to select it, skip to [Installing dependencies](#installing-dependencies)

If not, then hit 
>ctrl + shift + p

And then go to Python: select interpreter.

Then from the dropdown list, select Python 3.10.4 ('SEMRenv': venv)

### Activating the virtual environment
When activating the environment, there may be a problem where you cannot run activate the environment. It will say something similar to "running scripts on this system id is disabled"

To solve this, run - 

`Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope "CurrentUser" -ExecutionPolicy "Unrestricted"`

Then activate the environment by running - 

`./SEMRenv/Scripts/activate`

### Installing dependencies
`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

This may take a few minutes to complete as the dependencies will need to download

### Setting up run command
Once your depdencies have installed, run the following command - 

`python manage.py runserver`

### Opening the webapp
After a few seconds, you'll get output that says 

>Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/

Hold alt + left click while hovering over the link in the terminal. This will open the webapp. 

At this point, you will be able to access the demo cases that came with the webapp!

# Importing custom data

## Requirements
- A folder within SimpleEMRSystem/resources to store autogenerated cases (will need to be created)
- Box desktop

To run the translator, run -

`python data_type_translation/translator.py`

The translator file will pop up a window asking you for paths to each of the specified files. Once you fill in those paths and submit, then it will run each of the files

# Additional Notes
The SEMRinterface in meant to run in full screen mode on a 1920 x 1080 resolution monitor. Responsive html is not
currently supported. 

## Secondary Use

### Included data
Two studies are included, created from the full set of autogenerated data. 

## Versioning

Version 3.0. For the versions available, see https://github.com/ajk77/SimpleEMRSystem
