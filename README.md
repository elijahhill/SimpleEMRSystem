# Simple EMR System

This code can be used for Electronic Medical Record Research.

## Getting Started

First, have a look in the screenshots directory to become familiar with the interface design. 

### Prerequisites

Python 3 or Docker

### Installing


#### Python 

1. Clone repository
2. cd into project directory
3. enter "pip install -r requirements.txt"

#### Docker

1. Clone repository 

#### Python installation notes
It is strongly recommended that you use a virtual environment. Recommended to use python 3.10
1. enter "python -m venv __name_of_environment__"
2. enter "__name_of_environment__/Scripts/activate"
3. then follow the Python installation instructions shown above
4. to terminate the virtual environment, enter "deactivate"

### Deployment

##### Python 

1. cd into project directory
2. enter "python manage.py runserver"
3. open web browser to http://127.0.0.1:8000/SEMRinterface/ or http://127.0.0.1:8000/ (which redirects to the SEMRinterface endpoint)
4. terminate using ctrl+c

#### Docker
1. cd into project directory 
2. enter "docker-compose up"
3. open web browser to http://127.0.0.1:8000/SEMRinterface/ or http://127.0.0.1:8000/ (which redirects to the SEMRinterface endpoint)
4. terminate using ctrl+c

### Notes

The SEMRinterface in meant to run in full screen mode on a 1920 x 1080 resolution monitor. Responsive html is not
currently supported. 

## Secondary Use

### Included data
Two studies are included, created from the full set of autogenerated data. 

### Importing custom patient data
Using translator.py inside of the data_type_translation folder, set the three file paths (which further description is given
within the gui window that pops up). The output_folder should be under a folder contained within resources. In this case,
I have set up a folder called autogenerated_study that I have created.
